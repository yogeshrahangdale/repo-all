QUESTION 1
Create a procedure named 'insertRoute' which has route_name as an input parameter with varchar(255) as its datatype. This procedure should take the count of the existing table records(route table) and add 1 with that to generate the new route id. The newly generated id along with the route_name should be inserted into the route table.
In Solution, write a procedure alone with the given specifications. The calling of the procedure with the input will be taken care of in the back end.
Hints:
Procedure name: insertRoute
Parameters: route_name(varchar(255))

Input Format
The input tables are populated in the backend. 

Output Format
The output will display the below header if the procedure is created successfully.
